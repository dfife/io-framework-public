"""Typed perturbation carriers and explicit open seams for Phase 3.

This module packages the theorem-grade perturbation architecture already fixed
by Paper 32:

- `derived / scoped`: the solver lives on a closed-`S^3` typed tuple
- `derived / scoped`: baryon use is typed rather than one-slot
- `derived / scoped`: the remaining perturbation debt is exactly two open
  operators, not an unspecified patch space

The module deliberately makes the open seams first-class interfaces. Any caller
that tries to use them without a later theorem-grade implementation gets an
explicit boundary error.
