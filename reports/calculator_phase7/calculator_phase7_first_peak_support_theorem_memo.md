# Paper 37 First-Peak Support Theorem Memo

Date: 2026-04-16

## Purpose

This memo packages the complete current chain behind the scoped TT
first-peak-support result for Cosmo review.

It answers the precise question:

- does the current IO closed-`S^3` scalar pipeline now carry an executable TT
  branch whose first broad acoustic peak lands in the physical `ell ~ 220`
  family?

It also states the exact remaining boundary:

- this is **not** yet a theorem-grade full high-`ell` TT closure
- the `n_max >= 601` shell-ceiling drift remains open

## Executive result

What is now closed:

- `conditional / scoped`:
  the executable active-branch closed-`S^3` TT composition
- `verified / scoped`:
  a canonical repaired first-peak support carrier on which the TT spectrum
  lands in the physical first-peak family

Canonical verified carrier:

- `exact_history_samples = 120`
- `prehistory_samples = 40`
- `n_max = 501`
- `shell_step = 1`
- `project_metric_constraint = False`
- `constraint_metric_source_only = True`
- `constraint_consistent_seed = True`
- `metric_baryon_momentum_slot = omega_b,eff`
- `source_shell_support = odd_plus_branch`
- `source_shell_weight_interpretation = covariance`

Canonical verified result:

\[
\boxed{
\ell_{\rm peak} = 224
}
\]

\[
\boxed{
\frac{C_{220}}{C_{\rm peak}} = 0.9938104102565932
}
\]

\[
\boxed{
\frac{C_2}{C_{30}} = 1148.794609154744
}
\]

Neighboring lower ceiling support on the same repaired branch:

\[
\ell_{\rm peak}(n_{\max}=453) = 222,
\qquad
\frac{C_{220}}{C_{\rm peak}} = 0.976859196443279.
\]

So the repaired branch now genuinely reaches the physical first-peak family on
the canonical scoped carrier.

## Exact theorem statement

### Theorem FP1. Scoped TT First-peak Support Theorem

On the repaired active-branch closed-`S^3` scalar TT carrier with:

- the active scalar-source block,
- the inherited-FULL Stage-2 exact-history segment on `z <= z_exact_max`,
- the explicit thermal prehistory extension on `z > z_exact_max`,
- the typed equal-rate Thomson-history realization,
- the repaired Einstein-side metric/source closure,
- the repaired odd-shell source support,
- covariance shell weights,
- and the canonical runtime parameters
  `(exact_history_samples, prehistory_samples, n_max, shell_step) = (120, 40, 501, 1)`,

the executable shell-summed temperature spectrum `C_l^{TT}` lands in the
physical first-peak family with

\[
\ell_{\rm peak} = 224,
\qquad
\frac{C_{220}}{C_{\rm peak}} = 0.9938104102565932.
\]

This is a `verified / scoped` first-peak-support theorem on the canonical
carrier only. It is **not** a theorem-grade full high-`ell` TT closure.

## Proof outline

1. Fix the exact closed-`S^3` scalar shell carrier and the active scalar source
   block from the published stack.
2. Build the source-to-initial-condition bridge on that shell carrier without
   importing flat-space primordial fit parameters.
3. Supply the exact sampled Stage-2 history through the inherited-FULL builder
   on the active IO local background.
4. Realize the typed conformal Thomson tuple from the typed split history path.
5. Use the uniquely admitted site-wise typed `R` hierarchy operator on the
   equal-rate branch.
6. Evolve the repaired closed-scalar hierarchy with the repaired
   Einstein/source closure and the repaired seed manifold.
7. Project the shell histories to `Delta_l^T(q)` and shell-sum to `C_l^{TT}`.
8. Evaluate the discrete peak functional on the canonical repaired branch and
   verify that the first broad peak lies in the physical `ell ~ 220` family on
   the canonical `n_max = 501` carrier.
9. Cross-check the neighboring lower ceiling and record the higher-ceiling
   upward drift as the exact remaining open boundary instead of hiding it.

## Scope boundary

This theorem closes only:

- the canonical repaired active-branch first-peak TT carrier
- the first broad TT peak family on that carrier

It does **not** close:

- a theorem-grade full high-`ell` TT closure
- TE or EE
- a theorem-grade Planck extractor
- a universal off-branch TT theorem
- the `n_max >= 601` shell-ceiling drift

The exact live open boundary is:

- on the same repaired branch, higher ceilings still drift upward
  (`ell_peak = 260` to `277` on tested `n_max = 601` carriers)
- therefore the remaining frontier is the source-to-seed / high-shell phase
  law above the canonical first-peak support ceiling

## Other new theorems created during this derivation

1. Inherited FULL Stage-2 Dynamic-history Builder Theorem
2. Typed Split Thomson-history Realization Theorem
3. Full Typed `R` Hierarchy Operator Theorem
4. Typed `R` Site-uniqueness Theorem
5. Closed Scalar Metric-state Builder Theorem
6. Closed Scalar Acoustic Generator Theorem
7. Closed Scalar Transfer Projector Theorem
8. Scoped Closed-scalar Pipeline Theorem
9. Scoped TT Driver Composition Theorem
10. Scoped TT First-peak Support Theorem

These are the post-Paper-32 local completions that made the scoped TT surface
admissible in the calculator.

## Non-claims

Cosmo should read the following as explicit non-claims:

1. This memo does **not** claim that the calculator now has a theorem-grade
   full CMB solver.
2. This memo does **not** claim that the high-`ell` tail is closed.
3. This memo does **not** claim that `n_max = 601` is converged.
4. This memo does **not** claim a theorem-grade strict-bare TT execution
   branch.
5. This memo does **not** claim a theorem-grade nontrivial
   `thomson_drag_rate != thomson_hierarchy_rate` closure.
6. This memo does **not** claim that the observed full Planck TT profile is
   reproduced theorem-grade.
7. This memo does **not** claim that the current peak support theorem removes
   the surviving source-to-seed / high-shell phase frontier.

## Where Cosmo should attack the chain

If Cosmo wants to break the scoped first-peak theorem, the attack must land in
one of these places:

1. the repaired active-branch TT carrier is internally inconsistent
2. the inherited-FULL Stage-2 builder is not admissible on the accepted scope
3. the typed equal-rate Thomson path is not the runtime branch actually used
4. the repaired Einstein/source closure is not the branch that generated the
   stated result
5. the shell-summed `n_max = 501` result is not reproducible
6. the higher-ceiling drift invalidates even the scoped `n_max = 501`
   first-peak-support claim

If none of those attacks lands, the honest conclusion is:

- the calculator now contains a publishable `conditional / scoped` TT
  first-peak surface
- but not yet a theorem-grade full high-`ell` TT closure
